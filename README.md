WohaPlug
========

Wohaplug is an authentication plugin for bukkit, which utilizes the
simple api used on our server
[Gruvdrift](https://github.com/blambi/Gruvdrift).

This will replace wohasock since we have had some issues that might be
related to that approach.

Config
------

Currently there is only:

 - host: a hostname (web-server hosting the service)
 - port: an int specifying web servers port
